<p>
This paper investigates the spillover effects of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) on Chinese export firms, with a particular emphasis on a previously under-explored channel: global import-export linkages. Employing a shift-share instrumental variable (IV) strategy, we draw on both firm-transaction-level and industry-level data to show that increases in ETS allowance prices stimulate exports to the EU, while average export prices remain broadly stable.  We further decompose the aggregate export response into within-firm, between-firm, and entry/exit components, and find that the within-firm margin accounts for the majority of the overall effect. Counterfactual analyses based on back-of-the-envelope calculations further confirm that EU ETS shocks significantly shape China’s export patterns. The decomposition of counterfactual scenarios shows that uncertainty in EU ETS prices exerts an even larger effect, discouraging firms to adjust their export ratio. At the same time, the Matthew effects weaken due to the decrease of EU ETS price in reality. Finally, we construct a general equilibrium model to rationalize the empirical findings. EU ETS's carbon price mainly affects Chinese exporters through changes in the equilibrium price index of the destination market, generating the global “ripple effect”.
