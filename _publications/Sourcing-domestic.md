<p>
This paper examines how tariff hikes reshape the spatial distribution of domestic supply chains. We build a simplified producer–supplier model and construct a 2016–2019 panel of listed firms and their suppliers by merging five micro-level datasets. Theory and evidence show that higher tariffs significantly contract domestic supply chains: cross-province links decline, while new suppliers cluster locally. Falling profits push firms toward conservative sourcing, and risks from information asymmetry amplify this effect. By shortening supply chains, firms reduce transport and information costs under uncertainty. Results suggest tariffs weaken domestic market integration, highlighting the need to lower cross-regional sourcing costs.
