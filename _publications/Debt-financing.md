<summary>Summary</summary>
<p>
It is important for the financial system to lower the cost of borrowing, increase the supply of credit, and ensure the steady and high-quality growth of foreign trade. Focusing on these aspects, this paper constructs a partial equilibrium model and analyses it with actual data. The paper finds that exporters within the same industry generally enjoy lower debt financing costs. However, the same firms experience a significant increase in financing costs after they start exporting. The mechanism analysis confirms the conclusion of the model and shows that both the risk premium mechanism and the financing supply and demand mechanism are significant factors affecting the debt financing costs of firms. On the one hand, reduced systematic risk resulting from multinational marketing can reduce the debt financing costs of exporters. On the other hand, the relative size of financing needs and trade credit generated by exporting influence their debt financing costs through the supply and demand mechanism, causing variations across samples.
