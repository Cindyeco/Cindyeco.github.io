<summary>Summary</summary>
<p>
The stability and resilience of global supply chains have become critical issues in international business (IB) research, particularly amid rising geoeconomic decoupling risks. This paper investigates how multinational enterprises (MNEs) adjust their sourcing strategies in response to exogenous tariff shocks, with a focus on the 2018-2019 U.S.-China trade tensions. We find that higher U.S. import tariffs lead to two types of sourcing diversification. First, firms expanded their foreign supplier networks geographically, increasing sourcing from other high-income countries. Second, firms diversified inputs by increasing suppliers from other origins and engaging smaller suppliers. These adjustments are driven by two key mechanisms—export market reallocation and product scope expansion—highlighting the interdependence between trade policy, production structure, and supply chain design. Our findings challenge the notion of uniform decoupling by showing that tariff shocks induce strategic diversification rather than complete withdrawal.
